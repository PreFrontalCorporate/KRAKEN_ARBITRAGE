[AGENT] 🏃 Running command: git commit -m feat(8_MEV_Mempool_Simulation): Complete research module via agent

- Created `theory.tex` to serve as the main LaTeX file, including other sections using `\input`.
- Created `sections/` directory and added `1_mempool.tex`, `2_mev_strategies.tex`, and `3_game_theory.tex` files to organize the LaTeX content.
- Updated the Python code to fix type hints and bundle handling in the `Mempool` and `BlockBuilder` classes.
- Added more detailed comments and explanations to the Python code.
- Improved the structure and organization of both the LaTeX and Python code for better readability and maintainability.
- The LaTeX and Python code are now separated, making it easier to manage and update each part independently.
[AGENT] ✅ Command successful.
[AGENT] Changes committed. You can now 'git push' to save to remote.
