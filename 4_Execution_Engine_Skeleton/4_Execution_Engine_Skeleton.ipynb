#
# Part B: Colab-Ready Python Implementation Skeleton
#
# This code provides a foundational skeleton for a secure execution engine.
# It includes:
# 1. A MockKrakenAPI to simulate the exchange environment for testing.
# 2. An ExecutionEngine class to manage order lifecycle, state, and risk.
# 3. Unit tests to verify core functionality and safety mechanisms.
# 4. A dry-run mode for safe testing of execution logic.
#
# This skeleton is designed to be extended with sophisticated execution algorithms
# based on the theoretical principles outlined in Part A.
