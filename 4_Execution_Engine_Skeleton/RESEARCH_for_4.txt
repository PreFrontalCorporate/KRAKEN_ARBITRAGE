\section{Enhancements for Queue Position and Fill Probability}

\subsection{Modeling Queue Position}
To incorporate queue position effects, we extend the LOB model.  Instead of aggregated volume $v_i^b$ at price $p_i^b$, we maintain an ordered list of orders at that price level:
\[
\mathcal{B}_t = \{(p_i^b, Q_i^b)\}_{i=1}^{N_b}
\]
where $Q_i^b = [(q_{i1}, t_{i1}), (q_{i2}, t_{i2}), \dots]$ is a queue of (quantity, submission time) tuples, ordered by submission time.  A similar structure applies to the ask side.

When a limit order of size $q$ is submitted at price $p$, it is appended to the corresponding queue.  When a market order arrives, it consumes liquidity from the front of the queue at the best price.

\subsection{Fill Probability Constraints}
Fill probability for a limit order depends on its queue position, market volatility, and order flow dynamics.  A simplified model assumes a constant probability $\phi(p, q, pos)$ of being filled within a time interval $\Delta t$, where $p$ is the limit price, $q$ is the order size, and $pos$ is the queue position.

The execution problem now includes a constraint:
\[
P(\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} v_i^{fill} = X) \ge 1 - \epsilon
\]
where $\epsilon$ is the maximum acceptable probability of not fully filling the parent order.  This constraint can be approximated using the fill probability model $\phi$.

\section{Practical Implementation Details}

\subsection{Mock Kraken API Enhancements}
The Mock Kraken API should be extended to support:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Queue Position Simulation:} Maintain order queues at each price level and simulate queue position effects on fill probability.
    \item \textbf{WebSocket Stub:} Implement a basic WebSocket stub to simulate real-time market data updates.
    \item \textbf{More Realistic Order Matching:} Implement a more sophisticated order matching engine that considers order types, queue position, and hidden orders.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Execution Engine Enhancements}
The Execution Engine should be enhanced to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Queue Position Tracking:} Track the queue position of limit orders and use this information in execution decisions.
    \item \textbf{Fill Probability Estimation:} Implement a method to estimate fill probability based on queue position, market conditions, and order flow.
    \item \textbf{Advanced Order Types:} Implement support for more advanced order types, such as stop-loss orders and trailing stops.
\end{itemize}
