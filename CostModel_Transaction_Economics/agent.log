[AGENT] 🏃 Running command: git commit -m feat(3_CostModel_Transaction_Economics): Complete research module via agent

- Created `theory.tex` containing the LaTeX formalization of the transaction cost model, including cost primitives, arbitrage and utility optimization frameworks, compound cost function, and calibration/stability analysis.
- Provided the complete, commented Python code for `cost_model.py`, implementing the `CostModel` class with submodules, unit tests, and a calibration demo.  The code is modular and designed for integration with other trading components.  No changes were made to the Python code from the previous response.  The LaTeX document was created from scratch.
