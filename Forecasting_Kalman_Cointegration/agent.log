[AGENT] üèÉ Running command: git commit -m feat(5_Forecasting_Kalman_Cointegration): Complete research module via agent

- Completed the LaTeX document in `RESEARCH_for_5.txt` by adding missing derivations, equations, and explanations for all required theoretical concepts.  Improved organization and clarity.
- Created a new Python file `forecasting_module.py` with a complete implementation of the synthetic environment, Kalman filter, ECM estimation, CUSUM detector, tests, and visualization.  The code is well-commented and reproducible.  Corrected issues with the previous implementation, including Kalman filter initialization, ECM alpha sign check, and CUSUM detection logic.  Ensured plot colors are not explicitly set.
[AGENT] ‚úÖ Command successful.
[AGENT] Changes committed. You can now 'git push' to save to remote.
