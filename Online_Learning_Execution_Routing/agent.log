[AGENT] 🏃 Running command: git commit -m feat(6_Online_Learning_Execution_Routing): Complete research module via agent

- Created `theory.tex` containing the LaTeX theory for online order routing.
- Created `online_routing.py` with implementations of Mirror Descent (Exponentiated Gradient) and Thompson Sampling routers, a simulated market environment, plotting functions, and a main execution block for running simulations.
- Defined abstract base classes `CostModel` and `ExecutionEngine` and ensured the `MarketEnvironment` and routers interact through these interfaces.
- Implemented unit tests in `TestOnlineAlgorithms` to verify the core functionalities and theoretical properties of the algorithms.
- Improved the simulation code to demonstrate both sublinear regret in a gradually drifting environment and adaptability to a sudden regime shift.
- Used deques in `ThompsonSamplingRouter` for efficient sliding window updates.
- Improved numerical stability in `MirrorDescentRouter` by preventing weights from becoming too small and normalizing after each update.
- Improved clarity and coverage of the unit tests.
- Added plotting functions to visualize cumulative regret and action probabilities.
- Added comments and docstrings to improve code readability and documentation.
