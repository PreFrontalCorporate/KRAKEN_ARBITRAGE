Mathematical Foundations and Algorithmic Execution of Arbitrage on Decentralized ExchangesPart I: The Microstructure of Automated Market MakersThis report provides a mathematically rigorous and computationally exact framework for understanding and executing arbitrage strategies on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It begins by establishing the fundamental principles of Constant Function Market Makers (CFMMs), deriving their core trading formulas and proving essential mathematical properties. It then formulates DEX arbitrage as a graph-theoretic problem of negative cycle detection and concludes by developing a methodology for computing the maximal profitable trade size, complete with a reference implementation.Section 1: A Unified Theory of Constant Function Market MakersThe foundation of modern decentralized exchange is the Constant Function Market Maker. Unlike traditional order book-based exchanges, CFMMs utilize deterministic algorithms encoded in smart contracts to facilitate trades, providing continuous liquidity based on a predefined mathematical relationship between token reserves. This section establishes a unified theory for these systems.1.1 Defining the CFMM State and Trading ProcessA CFMM is defined by its state, which consists of a vector of token reserves R=(R1​,R2​,…,Rn​)∈R+n​, where Rj​ is the quantity of token j held by the contract.2 The core of any CFMM is its trading function (or invariant), ϕ:R+n​→R. All valid states of the reserves must lie on a level set of this function.3A trade is characterized by a tendered basket Δ∈R+n​ and a received basket Λ∈R+n​, where Δj​ is the amount of token j given to the pool and Λj​ is the amount of token j received from the pool. For a simple two-token swap of asset i for asset j, Δ would have a single non-zero component Δi​ and Λ would have a single non-zero component Λj​. The post-trade reserves are given by R′=R+Δ−Λ. A trade is deemed valid if and only if the post-trade reserves satisfy the invariant condition. In a theoretical fee-less model, this condition is ϕ(R′)=ϕ(R).21.2 Incorporating Trading FeesIn practice, CFMMs must charge fees to incentivize liquidity providers (LPs) to deposit their assets.5 These fees are typically a small percentage of the input amount. We can model this with a fee parameter γ∈(0,1], where γ=1−fee rate. The fee is applied to the tendered assets, so the effective amount added to the pool's reserves is γΔ. The invariant condition for a valid trade thus becomes 2:ϕ(R+γΔ−Λ)=ϕ(R)This formulation reveals a critical property: the post-trade reserves, R′=R+γΔ−Λ, do not lie on the same level set as the pre-trade reserves R. Instead, since γ<1, the total value locked in the pool increases with each trade. This increase in the value of ϕ(R) represents the value captured by LPs as compensation for providing liquidity.71.3 Axiomatic Properties: Monotonicity and ConcavityThe behavior of CFMMs is not arbitrary; it is governed by fundamental economic principles that can be expressed as mathematical axioms. The set of all achievable reserve states, S, must satisfy certain geometric properties to represent a rational market.3 Specifically, the set S must be convex and upward-closed (i.e., if R∈S, then any R′≥R is also in S). These axioms are not mere assumptions but necessary conditions for a market that does not offer perverse incentives, such as offering better prices for larger trades.From these geometric axioms, we can derive two crucial properties of the trading function ϕ:Monotonicity (Non-decreasing): The upward-closed property of the reserve set implies that the trading function ϕ must be non-decreasing. If one increases the amount of any reserve, the value of the function cannot decrease. This ensures that adding assets to the pool never makes it "less valuable" from the perspective of the invariant.3Concavity: The convexity of the reserve set implies that the trading function ϕ must be concave. A function is concave if the line segment connecting any two points on its graph lies on or below the graph itself.3The property of concavity is the fundamental mathematical origin of price impact (also known as slippage). For a concave function, the slope (its first derivative) is a decreasing function. In a CFMM, the marginal price of one asset in terms of another is given by the negative of the slope of the trading curve. As a trader deposits more of an input asset, they move along this curve. The concavity ensures that the slope becomes progressively smaller, meaning the marginal rate of the output asset received per unit of input asset decreases. This inherent relationship between concavity and diminishing marginal returns is what guarantees that larger trades receive exponentially worse execution prices, a cornerstone of CFMM stability and a primary factor that arbitrageurs must model and overcome.6 This property also ensures that the profit function for an arbitrage trade is itself concave, which guarantees the existence of a unique, optimal trade size that can be found via numerical optimization.Section 2: Analysis of Constant-Product AMMs (Uniswap v2)The most canonical example of a CFMM is the constant-product market maker, popularized by Uniswap v2. Its behavior is defined by a simple yet powerful algebraic relationship.72.1 The Constant Product InvariantFor a pool with two tokens, with reserves x and y, the trading function is ϕ(x,y)=x⋅y. The invariant rule states that for any trade, the product of the reserves must remain constant (or, more accurately, must not decrease when accounting for fees).6x⋅y=kThis equation defines a hyperbola in the positive quadrant, which serves as the trading curve. Any valid trade moves the reserve state from one point on this curve to another.2.2 Derivation of the Exact Trade Formula (with Fee)Let the initial reserves be (x0​,y0​), so k=x0​y0​. A trader wishes to swap an amount Δx of token X for an amount Δy of token Y. The fee rate is f, so the fee parameter is γ=1−f. The amount of token X added to the pool's reserves is γΔx. The new reserves will be (x0​+γΔx,y0​−Δy). To satisfy the invariant, we must have 6:(x0​+γΔx)(y0​−Δy)=x0​y0​We can solve this equation for the output amount, Δy, as a function of the input amount, Δx:y0​−Δy=x0​+γΔxx0​y0​​Δy=y0​−x0​+γΔxx0​y0​​Δy=x0​+γΔxy0​(x0​+γΔx)−x0​y0​​Δy=x0​+γΔxx0​y0​+y0​γΔx−x0​y0​​This yields the exact trade formula for a constant-product AMM 6:Δyout​=x0​+γΔxin​y0​γΔxin​​This formula is the computational core of any Uniswap v2-style interaction and demonstrates that the output is a function of both the trade size and the pool's reserves.2.3 Marginal Price and Price ImpactThe price dynamics of the pool can be analyzed in detail.Marginal Price (Spot Price): The instantaneous price for an infinitesimally small trade is the negative of the slope of the trading curve y=k/x. This is found by taking the derivative 6:Pspot​=−dxdy​=−(−x2k​)=x2k​=x2xy​=xy​The spot price is simply the ratio of the reserves.12Effective Price: For a finite trade of size Δx, the actual price paid is the effective price, defined as the ratio of the total amount out to the total amount in:Peff​=ΔxΔy​=x0​+γΔxy0​γ​It is clear that for any Δx>0, Peff​<γx0​y0​​=γPspot​. The trader always receives a worse rate than the spot price, and this deviation increases with trade size.Price Impact: Price impact quantifies this deviation. It is the percentage difference between the ideal price (the spot price, adjusted for the fee) and the effective price received.11Price Impact(Δx)=γPspot​γPspot​−Peff​​=1−γPspot​Peff​​Substituting the expressions for Peff​ and Pspot​:Price Impact(Δx)=1−γx0​y0​​x0​+γΔxy0​γ​​=1−x0​+γΔxx0​​=x0​+γΔxγΔx​This closed-form expression shows that price impact is a direct function of the trade size relative to the initial reserve of the input asset.2.4 Proof of Monotonicity and ConcavityThe properties of the constant-product model can be formally proven.Monotonicity: The function relating the reserves is y(x)=k/x. Its first derivative is y′(x)=−k/x2. Since reserves x and the constant k are always positive, y′(x)<0. This proves the function is strictly decreasing, meaning an increase in one reserve must be met with a decrease in the other.Concavity: The second derivative of the function is y′′(x)=2k/x3. Since k>0 and x>0, we have y′′(x)>0. This proves that the trading curve is strictly convex (concave up). As established in Section 1.3, this convexity is the direct mathematical cause of price impact.Section 3: Analysis of Hybrid-Function AMMs (Curve Stableswap)While the constant-product model is robust, its high price impact is inefficient for assets that are expected to trade at a stable 1:1 ratio, such as different types of stablecoins (e.g., USDC vs. DAI) or wrapped assets (e.g., WETH vs. stETH). Curve Finance introduced the Stableswap invariant to address this by creating a hybrid model that significantly reduces slippage around a target price.173.1 The Stableswap InvariantThe Stableswap model combines the constant-sum invariant, ∑xi​=D, which provides zero slippage but is vulnerable to liquidity depletion, with the constant-product invariant, ∏xi​=(D/n)n, which ensures infinite liquidity but has high slippage.15 The resulting hybrid invariant for a pool with n coins is 19:Anni=1∑n​xi​+D=ADnn+nn∏i=1n​xi​Dn+1​Here, xi​ is the reserve of coin i, D is a variable representing the total virtual liquidity in the pool, and A is the "amplification coefficient."3.2 The Role of the Amplification Coefficient AThe amplification coefficient, A, is the key innovation of the Stableswap model. It is not merely a static parameter but functions as a form of dynamic, state-dependent leverage that controls the shape of the trading curve.19When the pool's reserves are balanced (i.e., xi​≈D/n for all i), the product term ∏xi​ is maximized. In this state, the invariant equation is dominated by the terms involving the sum, weighted by the large coefficient A. A high value for A (e.g., A=100) effectively "amplifies" the constant-sum component, causing the trading curve to become very flat, closely approximating the zero-slippage behavior of x+y=D.20 This allows for large trades between stable assets with minimal price impact.Conversely, as the pool becomes imbalanced due to large trades or external price movements, the product term ∏xi​ decreases rapidly. This diminishes the influence of the sum term, and the invariant's behavior transitions to become dominated by the constant-product term. This ensures that, like Uniswap, the pool can never be fully drained of one asset, preserving liquidity across all price points, albeit at an increasingly high cost.19 Therefore, A provides high leverage and capital efficiency when the market is stable and automatically reduces this leverage to protect the pool's solvency during periods of volatility. This non-linear behavior makes the model highly effective but precludes simple analytical solutions for trade calculations.3.3 Calculating Trades: The get_y FunctionTo calculate the output of a trade on a Curve pool, one must solve the invariant equation for the new reserve amount of the output token. Given an input Δxi​ into a pool with reserves (xi​,xj​,…), the new reserve xi′​ is xi​+Δxi​ (ignoring fees for simplicity). We must then find the new reserve xj′​ that keeps the invariant satisfied. This requires finding the root of a complex polynomial.For a two-coin pool, if we are solving for the new balance y (i.e., xj′​) given a new balance for the other token, the invariant can be rearranged into a quadratic-like form in y 21:f(y)=y2+(b−D)y−c=0where the coefficients b and c are functions of the other reserves, A, and D:b=S′+AnnD​,c=AnnP′Dn+1​Here, S′ and P′ are the sum and product of all reserves except for the one we are solving for, y. Because this equation (and its higher-order equivalents for multi-coin pools) does not have a simple closed-form solution, it must be solved numerically. The standard method used in Curve's smart contracts is Newton's method, an iterative root-finding algorithm.21 The iterative update rule to find the root of f(y)=0 is:yk+1​=yk​−f′(yk​)f(yk​)​Substituting our specific function f(y) and its derivative f′(y)=2y+b−D, we get the update rule for finding the new reserve balance y:yk+1​=yk​−2yk​+b−Dyk2​+(b−D)yk​−c​=2yk​+b−Dyk2​+c​This iterative process is repeated until the value of yk​ converges to a stable solution, which represents the new reserve of the output token.Part II: Arbitrage in the DEX NetworkHaving established the mechanics of individual AMM pools, we now generalize to a network of interconnected pools. Arbitrage opportunities arise from price discrepancies within this network, and their detection can be elegantly framed as a problem in graph theory.Section 4: The Arbitrage GraphThe entire DEX ecosystem can be modeled as a single, unified mathematical structure.4.1 Graph RepresentationWe model the network of DEXs as a directed graph G=(V,E). The set of vertices V represents the universe of available tokens (e.g., ETH, USDC, DAI). A directed edge (u,v)∈E exists if there is at least one liquidity pool that allows for the direct exchange of token u for token v.254.2 Edge Weights as Exchange RatesEach edge (u,v) is assigned a weight that represents the exchange rate for converting token u into token v. A critical complexity is that this rate is not a constant value but a function of the trade size, Ruv​(Δu), due to price impact. For the initial task of detecting an arbitrage opportunity, we can simplify by considering the marginal rate for a near-zero trade size, Ruv​(0), which is derived from the pool's spot price and includes the trading fee.4.3 The Logarithmic Transformation and the Negative Cycle EquivalenceAn arbitrage opportunity exists if there is a sequence of trades (a cycle in the graph) that results in a net profit. For a cycle of trades starting with token T1​ and returning to T1​ via tokens T2​,…,Tn​, a profitable arbitrage exists if the product of the exchange rates is greater than 1 26:RT1​→T2​​⋅RT2​→T3​​⋅⋯⋅RTn​→T1​​>1This multiplicative relationship is computationally cumbersome. However, it can be transformed into a more tractable additive problem through a logarithmic transformation. This leads to the central theorem of DEX arbitrage detection.Theorem: A profitable arbitrage opportunity exists in a network of CFMMs if and only if the corresponding graph G, with edge weights defined as wuv​=−ln(Ruv​), contains a negative-weight cycle.Proof:Start with the condition for a profitable arbitrage cycle:R1​⋅R2​⋅⋯⋅Rn​>1Take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, the inequality is preserved:ln(R1​⋅R2​⋅⋯⋅Rn​)>ln(1)Using the property of logarithms that ln(ab)=ln(a)+ln(b), we can rewrite the left side as a sum:ln(R1​)+ln(R2​)+⋯+ln(Rn​)>0Multiply the entire inequality by -1, which reverses the direction of the inequality:(−ln(R1​))+(−ln(R2​))+⋯+(−ln(Rn​))<0Define the weight of the edge corresponding to the trade with rate Ri​ as wi​=−ln(Ri​). The condition becomes:i=1∑n​wi​<0This is precisely the definition of a negative-weight cycle in the graph. Thus, the existence of a profitable arbitrage cycle is mathematically equivalent to the existence of a negative-weight cycle in the log-transformed graph. Q.E.D..27This transformation is exceptionally powerful because it allows us to use well-established shortest-path algorithms from computer science to solve a problem in financial arbitrage.Section 5: Pathfinding Algorithms for Arbitrage DetectionThe task of finding a negative cycle in a weighted directed graph is a classic problem for which efficient algorithms have been developed.5.1 Why Bellman-Ford?While several shortest-path algorithms exist, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, they often come with the constraint that all edge weights must be non-negative. Our formulation explicitly requires negative edge weights to represent profitable trades. The Bellman-Ford algorithm is the canonical choice for this problem because it is specifically designed to work correctly on graphs that contain negative-weight edges.295.2 Algorithm MechanicsThe Bellman-Ford algorithm finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in the graph. Its ability to detect negative cycles is a byproduct of its operational mechanism.29The algorithm proceeds as follows:Initialization: For a graph with ∣V∣ vertices, create a distance array dist of size ∣V∣ and a predecessor array pred of size ∣V∣. Initialize all distances to infinity (dist[v] = \infty$) except for a chosen source vertex $s$, for which dist[s] = 0`. Initialize all predecessors to a null value.Relaxation: Iterate ∣V∣−1 times. In each iteration, loop through every edge (u,v) in the graph and perform a "relaxation" step:$$\text{if } \text{dist}[u] + w(u, v) < \text{dist}[v]:
$$   $$
\quad \text{dist}[v] = \text{dist}[u] + w(u, v)
$$   $$
\quad \text{pred}[v] = u$$After k iterations, the algorithm guarantees to have found the shortest path from the source to any other vertex that uses at most k edges. Since a simple path cannot have more than ∣V∣−1 edges, this process finds all shortest simple paths.Negative Cycle Detection: Perform one final, ∣V∣-th iteration of relaxation over all edges. If any distance dist[v] can still be improved during this final pass, it means that the shortest path to v is not a simple path and must involve a cycle. Because the only way a cycle can further reduce a path's length is if the cycle itself has a negative total weight, any update in this phase proves the existence of a negative cycle reachable from the source vertex.275.3 Reconstructing the Arbitrage PathWhen the final relaxation step identifies an edge (u,v) where dist[v] is updated, this vertex v is part of or reachable from a negative cycle. To reconstruct the cycle itself, one can start from vertex v and repeatedly trace back using the predecessor array pred. By moving from v to pred[v], then to pred[pred[v]], and so on, one will eventually encounter a vertex that appears twice. The sequence of vertices between these two occurrences forms the negative cycle, which corresponds to the profitable arbitrage path.27Part III: Optimal Profit Extraction and ImplementationDetecting a negative cycle confirms that a profitable arbitrage opportunity exists for an infinitesimally small trade. However, due to price impact, the profitability of the cycle diminishes as the trade size increases. The final and most critical step is to determine the optimal trade size that maximizes the net profit.Section 6: The Science of Optimal Trade SizingThis section formulates profit maximization as a one-dimensional optimization problem and analyzes methods for its solution.6.1 Formulating the Profit FunctionFor a given arbitrage cycle consisting of a sequence of pools, we can define a composite function that maps an initial input amount of a token, Δxin​, to the final output amount of the same token, Δxout​. If the cycle involves trades through pools 1,2,…,n with trade functions f1​,f2​,…,fn​, then:Δxout​=fn​(fn−1​(…f2​(f1​(Δxin​))…))The profit function, P(Δxin​), is simply the difference between the final output and the initial input 32:P(Δxin​)=Δxout​−Δxin​A crucial, universal property of this profit function emerges from the underlying mathematics of CFMMs. As established in Section 1.3, the trading function of any well-behaved CFMM is concave. The output of a single trade, as a function of its input, is therefore a concave function. An arbitrage cycle involves the composition of these concave functions. The composition of concave, increasing functions is itself concave. Subtracting the linear term Δxin​ preserves this concavity. Consequently, the end-to-end profit function P(Δxin​) for any arbitrage cycle across well-behaved CFMMs is guaranteed to be concave. This is a powerful result, as it ensures that the profit function has a single, unique maximum. This makes the optimization problem well-posed and guarantees that numerical optimization methods will not get trapped in local maxima, but will instead converge to the single global optimum.6.2 Analytical Solution for Two-Pool Uniswap v2 CycleFor the simplest case of a two-pool arbitrage cycle between identical Uniswap v2-style pools, it is possible to derive a closed-form analytical solution for the optimal trade size. This involves constructing the profit function, taking its derivative with respect to the input amount Δxin​, setting the derivative to zero (P′(Δxin​)=0), and solving for Δxin​. This process results in a quadratic equation whose root gives the optimal trade size.32 This analytical solution serves as an invaluable tool for validating and unit-testing the more general numerical methods.6.3 Numerical Optimization for Complex CyclesFor more complex cycles involving three or more pools, or pools with different invariants like Curve's Stableswap, an analytical solution for the optimal trade size is generally intractable. In these cases, we must employ numerical optimization techniques to find the maximum of the profit function P(Δxin​). This is equivalent to finding the root of its derivative, P′(Δxin​)=0.Two prominent methods are suitable for this one-dimensional optimization problem:Newton's Method (Newton-Raphson): This is a root-finding algorithm that uses the function's first and second derivatives to converge rapidly to a root. To find the maximum of P(x), we seek the root of P′(x). The iterative update rule is xk+1​=xk​−P′(xk​)/P′′(xk​). Newton's method exhibits quadratic convergence, meaning the number of correct digits roughly doubles with each iteration, making it extremely fast when it works.34 However, it requires the analytical computation of both the first and second derivatives of the complex, composite profit function, which can be difficult. It can also be unstable if the initial guess is far from the optimum.Brent's Method: This is a hybrid algorithm that combines the guaranteed convergence of the bisection method with the speed of the secant method and inverse quadratic interpolation.36 It is a "bracketing" method, meaning it requires an initial interval [a,b] where the function's values at the endpoints have opposite signs (for root-finding) or where a minimum is known to exist (for optimization). Its key advantage is robustness; it is guaranteed to converge. Furthermore, it does not require the computation of any derivatives, only the evaluation of the profit function P(x) itself, making it significantly easier to implement for complex profit functions.37 While its convergence is superlinear (slower than quadratic), its reliability and implementation simplicity often make it the preferred choice for this application.Table 1: Comparison of Numerical Optimization Methods for ArbitrageMethodConvergence RateDerivative Required?RobustnessImplementation ComplexityUse Case in DEX ArbitrageNewton's MethodQuadraticYes (P′ and P′′)Moderate (sensitive to initial guess)High (requires deriving complex derivatives)Optimal for performance-critical applications where derivatives can be computed efficiently and reliably.Brent's MethodSuperlinear (~1.618)No (only P)High (guaranteed convergence with bracket)Low (uses the profit function as a black box)Ideal for general-purpose arbitrage bots due to its robustness and ease of implementation across diverse and complex cycle types.Given its balance of speed, robustness, and implementation simplicity, Brent's method is an excellent choice for a general-purpose arbitrage trade size optimizer.Section 7: A Reference Implementation in PythonThe theoretical concepts developed in the preceding sections are now consolidated into a practical, Colab-ready Python implementation. This code serves as a reference for building a functional arbitrage detection and execution engine.7.1 AMM Stepper ImplementationThe core of the simulation is a set of classes that accurately model the behavior of different AMM pools.UniswapV2Pool: This class implements the get_amount_out method using the exact analytical formula derived in Section 2.2: Δy=(y⋅γΔx)/(x+γΔx).CurveStableswapPool: This class implements the more complex logic for a two-coin Stableswap pool. Its get_amount_out method uses a numerical solver (scipy.optimize.newton) to find the new reserve balance by iteratively solving the invariant equation, as detailed in Section 3.3.217.2 Graph Construction and PathfindingThe script constructs a directed graph where nodes are token names and edges represent the available AMM pools. Edge weights are calculated as the negative logarithm of the post-fee marginal exchange rate. The Bellman-Ford algorithm is then implemented to traverse this graph and identify any negative-weight cycles, which, as proven in Section 4.3, correspond to profitable arbitrage opportunities.317.3 Optimal Size CalculationOnce a negative cycle is identified, the next step is to find the optimal trade size.A profit function, calculate_profit(dx_in, cycle), is defined. This function takes an input trade size and the sequence of pools in the cycle. It simulates the series of swaps, propagating the output of one trade as the input to the next, and returns the final net profit (or loss).The scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar function is then used to find the optimal input amount. By providing a negated version of the profit function and specifying method='brent', the optimizer efficiently finds the value of dx_in that maximizes the profit without requiring analytical derivatives.387.4 Unit Testing and VerificationTo ensure the correctness of the implementation, the code includes several unit tests.The UniswapV2Pool stepper is tested against the known analytical solution for a two-pool arbitrage, verifying its numerical accuracy.A crucial test case confirms that if trading fees are set high enough to eliminate a price discrepancy, the optimizer correctly identifies that the optimal trade size is zero, resulting in no profit. This validates the end-to-end logic of the system.Part IV: Advanced Considerations and Future OutlookThe model presented provides a complete and mathematically sound framework for basic DEX arbitrage. However, the real-world environment introduces complexities that are abstracted away in this model. This final part discusses these limitations and points toward more advanced topics.Section 8: Model Assumptions, Limitations, and ExtensionsA critical awareness of the model's underlying assumptions is necessary for any practical application.Static Reserves: The entire process of detection and optimization assumes that the pool reserves remain static between the moment they are observed and the moment the arbitrage transaction is executed. In reality, DEX pools are in a constant state of flux, and a profitable opportunity can vanish in milliseconds due to the actions of other traders. This creates execution risk.No Front-Running/MEV: The model operates in a vacuum, ignoring the adversarial nature of public blockchain mempools. In practice, a submitted arbitrage transaction is visible to sophisticated actors who can execute "sandwich attacks"—placing a trade immediately before and after the arbitrageur's transaction to capture the profit for themselves.41 This phenomenon is a major component of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV).Gas Costs: The profit calculations in the model do not account for the transaction fees (gas) required to execute the trades on the blockchain. A detected opportunity is only truly profitable if the maximized profit, P(Δxopt​), exceeds the total gas cost of the transaction.Execution Ordering and Multi-Pool Routing: The model assumes a sequential execution of trades along a single path. Advanced arbitrage bots may split a large trade across multiple parallel pools connecting the same pair of assets to minimize price impact, a problem known as optimal routing.2Section 9: Frontiers in DEX ArbitrageThe principles established in this report serve as a foundation for exploring more advanced frontiers in decentralized finance.Concentrated Liquidity (Uniswap v3): Uniswap v3 and similar protocols introduce "concentrated liquidity," where LPs provide assets within specific price ranges rather than across the entire price curve.1 This makes the AMM far more capital-efficient but also complicates arbitrage calculations significantly. Instead of a single x·y=k curve, the trading function becomes a piecewise combination of virtual curves, requiring more sophisticated logic to calculate trade outputs and optimal sizes.44Cross-Chain Arbitrage: The same principles of price discrepancy can be extended to opportunities that exist between different blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum and Solana).46 This introduces new challenges related to network latency, transaction finality, and the security and cost of using cross-chain bridges to move assets.47The Arbitrage-MEV Symbiosis: DEX arbitrage is a primary driver of MEV on blockchains.48 The intense, high-frequency competition for these opportunities has created a complex ecosystem of "searchers" (who find opportunities), "builders" (who construct blocks), and "relays" that has profound implications for the economic security, centralization, and fairness of the underlying blockchain protocols.49 Understanding the mathematics of arbitrage is the first step toward understanding this broader, critical dynamic.Pythonimport numpy as np
